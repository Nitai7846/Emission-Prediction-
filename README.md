# Emission-Prediction-
A set of models for emission prediction from Gas Turbines

The data for this model is collected from 9 sensors on a Gas Turbine. The features are 
AT – Ambient Temperature
AP – Ambient Pressure
AH – Ambient Humidity 
AFDP – Air Filter Discharge Pressure 
GTEP – Gas Turbine Exit Pressure
TIT – Turbine Inlet Temperature
TAT – Turbine After Temperature
TEY – Total Energy Yield
CDP – Compressor Discharge Pressure

The target variables are 
CO – Carbon Monoxide Concentration
NOX – Nitrogen Oxides Concentration
